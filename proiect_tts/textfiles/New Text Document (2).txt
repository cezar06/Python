The cat was curled up on the windowsill, fast asleep.
The clock on the wall ticked loudly in the quiet room.
She reached out and took his hand in hers.
The music was playing softly in the background.
He walked down the street, lost in thought.
The delicious smell of freshly baked bread filled the air.
